The Selfluv Manifesto

Selfluv is not self-indulgence.
It is attentional responsibility.

We do not experience life as it is.
We experience life as we attend to it.

Attention is the most valuable resource we have, because it shapes:

how time is felt

how meaning is formed

who we become

Time passes regardless.
Attention decides what stays.

At every moment, we are training ourselves—
through what we give our attention to
and what we repeatedly ignore.

Selfluv is the practice of placing attention where it reduces internal distance rather than increases it.

We call attention invested when it closes the gap between:

our current state

and our honest expectations

We call attention spent when it widens that gap.

Suffering is not pain.
Suffering is misaligned attention.

Happiness is not pleasure or achievement.
Happiness is the absence of internal distance—
when who we are, what we are doing, and what we expect of ourselves are no longer in conflict.

Selfluv does not mean avoiding discomfort.
It means choosing the discomfort that leads to coherence.

Selfluv is not thinking kinder thoughts.
It is choosing better objects of attention.

What we repeatedly attend to becomes our inner environment.
What we practice internally becomes our external life.

Selfluv is how we return to ourselves—
again and again—
by choosing where our attention belongs.
